# Implementation Plan

## Overview

Ralph-Sessions: A hybrid autonomous development system combining RALPHED's autonomous bash loop with specialized agents for structured, self-correcting development workflows.

## Tasks

> Each task is a single, focused unit of work completed in one iteration.
> Tasks are processed in order. Check off completed tasks.

- [ ] Verify directory structure and templates
- [ ] Test single iteration workflow
- [ ] Test multi-iteration workflow
- [ ] Test code review loop-back behavior
- [ ] Test backlog queue processing

## Completed Tasks

> Tasks move here after successful completion

## Backlog

> Items queued from code reviews (suggestions, deferred warnings)
> These are considered for future iterations
